| [**keepalive.ps1**](https://github.com/cwnit/toolkits/blob/master/collections/powershell/system_management/keepalive.ps1) | The script can help keep your Windows logons active and ready for work. It simply activates then deactivates the Scroll Lock button every four minutes. This sends a signal to the operating system that someone (technically something) is using the computer and thus your session remains alive. <br> <br> *__Limits:__* The script should be saved to your MyDocuments folder so it funs with least privilleged, you must be able to run a powershell script.   <br><br> *__Instructions:__* "  Open Notepad, copy the code from the repository and paste the code into notepad file. >> Save file as keepalive.ps1 >> double click to execute, windows must remain On so minimize the screen in order to maintain productivity. "  <br> <br> *__Disclaimer:__*  3 this identifies the column number where the column name lives. |
